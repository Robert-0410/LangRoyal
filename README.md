# LangRoyal
The plan is to implement a program in various languages and compare them.

#### TODO
- Need an idea for a simple program that could be written without dependencies.
- Implementations: Lua, Python, Kotlin, C **Order not important**

## Idea
Web server that upon request generates two pseudo random numbers and performs
(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The response will be
the computed data.
